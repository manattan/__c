Table. Estimates of Codon-based Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences 
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site from between sequences are shown. Analyses were conducted using the Pamilo-Bianchi-Li model [1]. The analysis involved 10 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 484 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [2].
